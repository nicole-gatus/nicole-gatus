Hi, I'm Nicole!

I'm a Software Associate I. 

I recently learned: 
- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Jquery

I'm interested in building wonderful websites and dashboards that's why I plan to study react soon. 

I will try my very best to upload projects every 3 months at least. You see, there's a lot on my plate in the real world. But I'm happy to collaborate and learn with other people!
